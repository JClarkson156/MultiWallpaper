# MultiWallpaper


Just a basic wallpaper program that is ~ 8 years old. Created after Windows 10 upgrade where it didn't look in subfolders for images.

Allows you to decide what folders to use for images. And creates a large image to use as a wallpaper.

Has a few other clean up features I've added to it over the years. To remove duplicates, small images and sort images from my downloads folder.
